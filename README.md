# ReactNative-AccountBook-RNCLI

This app is my account book<br/>
I made Five screens: Main Screen, Detail Screen, Add/Update Screen, Calendar Screen and Camera Screen.<br/>
On the main screen, you can check your income and consumption.<br/>
And you can check monthly income and consumption with the stack bar.<br/>
If you click add button at the bottom right of the main screen, you will move to the add screen.<br/>
In the add screen, you can write the amount, content, date and image.<br/>
Click on the image section to take a photo.<br/>
